React Timer App - Customised

This is the branch where I'll tweak some bits and bobs.

To create a new branch in a repo, do the following:

git checkout -b "[YOUR BRANCH NAME]"

The above uses the -b to create a branch, and checkout checks it out.

You'll also be switched to the new branch, so any future commits etc will be on that branch..
